# League of Our Own - Project Documentation

**Fantasy Football Application - Technical Documentation Hub**

*Last updated: 2025-07-25*

## About This Documentation

This documentation tracks the **evolutionary improvement** of an established fantasy football web application. The project was already functional when systematic documentation began, so the tasks you'll see represent **planned enhancements** rather than initial development.

## Quick Navigation

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Implementation**
- **[System Architecture](architecture.md)** - Complete technical stack and architectural decisions
- **[Database Schema](database.md)** - PostgreSQL schema, patterns, and best practices

### üìö **Learning & Decision History**
- **[Lessons Learned](lessons-learned/)** - Technical insights, patterns, and solutions discovered
- **[Architecture Decisions](lessons-learned/architecture-decisions/)** - Rationale behind major technical choices

### üìã **Work Management**
- **[Current Sprint](tasks/current.md)** - Active development focus and current tasks
- **[Completed Work](tasks/completed.md)** - Historical record of completed tasks with story points
- **[Backlog](tasks/backlog.md)** - Future enhancement candidates prioritized by value

## Task Management System

This project uses **standard agile methodology** with story points for estimation:

### **Task Categories**
- **Feature**: New functionality (e.g., security integration, new components)
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing features (e.g., performance, architecture refactoring)
- **Bug**: Something broken that needs fixing (e.g., form display issues, type errors)
- **Chore**: Maintenance work (e.g., dependency updates, configuration, tooling)
- **Documentation**: Doc updates and improvements

### **Task Format**
```
‚úÖ Enhancement: Extract business logic to composables - 2025-01-08
üîÑ Feature: Advanced player filtering
üìã Chore: Nuxt 4 migration
```

## How to Use This Documentation

### üîç **For Current Development**
1. Check **[Current Sprint](tasks/current.md)** for active priorities and capacity
2. Reference **[Architecture](architecture.md)** for implementation patterns
3. Review **[Lessons Learned](lessons-learned/)** for similar challenges

### üêõ **For Debugging Issues**
1. Start with **[Vue Reactivity Patterns](lessons-learned/vue-reactivity-patterns.md)** for common pitfalls
2. Check **[Composable Architecture](lessons-learned/composable-architecture.md)** for component issues
3. Review **[Completed Work](tasks/completed.md)** for similar fixes

### üöÄ **For Planning New Features**
1. Review **[Architecture Decisions](lessons-learned/architecture-decisions/)** for established patterns
2. Check **[Backlog](tasks/backlog.md)** for related planned work
3. Consider **[Security Patterns](lessons-learned/security-implementation-patterns.md)** for user-facing features

### üîß **For Implementation Guidance**
1. Follow established patterns in **[Architecture](architecture.md)**
2. Use **[Database Schema](database.md)** for data modelling
3. Apply lessons from **[Lessons Learned](lessons-learned/)** to avoid known pitfalls

## Key Technical Context

### **Application Status**
- **Established**: 1989/1990 fantasy football league
- **Technology**: Nuxt 3 SPA with Supabase backend
- **Architecture**: Composable-based Vue 3 with TypeScript strict mode
- **Users**: Friends/family league (private, trusted user base)

### **Development Approach**
- **Test-Driven Development**: All business logic must have failing tests first
- **TypeScript Strict**: No `any` types, comprehensive type safety
- **Functional Patterns**: Immutable data, pure functions, composition
- **Incremental Improvement**: Small, safe changes maintaining working state

### **Quality Standards**
- **Zero Technical Debt**: All identified issues must be resolved
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% behaviour coverage for business logic
- **Documentation First**: All decisions and learnings must be captured
- **User Experience**: Optimised for elderly users with simple, clear interfaces

## Recent Major Achievements

### **Team Builder Enhancement (2025)**
- ‚úÖ **Enhancement: Zero TypeScript errors** - Complete type safety restoration
- ‚úÖ **Enhancement: Composable architecture** - Business logic extracted for testability
- ‚úÖ **Feature: Cloudflare Turnstile security** - Bot protection integration
- ‚úÖ **Bug: Complex Vue reactivity issues** - Form display and state management fixes

### **Infrastructure Improvements**
- ‚úÖ **Chore: TDD setup** - Vitest configuration with global mocking
- ‚úÖ **Enhancement: Type system** - Auto-generated types with custom overrides
- ‚úÖ **Documentation: Comprehensive lessons learned** - Knowledge capture

## Development Progress

Based on completed work, focus is on steady incremental improvements with quality over quantity approach.

## Documentation Maintenance

### **When to Update**
- After completing any development task
- When discovering new technical patterns or solutions
- After resolving complex bugs or architectural issues
- When making architectural or technology decisions

### **What to Document**
- **Rationale**: Why decisions were made, not just what was implemented
- **Context**: Application state before and after changes
- **Lessons**: What was learned that would be useful in future
- **Patterns**: Reusable solutions and anti-patterns to avoid

## Getting Help

### **For Claude Code Sessions**
This documentation is optimised for AI assistance. Key files provide:
- **Context**: What's been tried before and why
- **Patterns**: Established approaches that work
- **Pitfalls**: Known issues and their solutions
- **Standards**: Code quality and architectural requirements

### **For Future Development**
The lessons learned section captures institutional knowledge including:
- Complex bug resolutions with root cause analysis
- Architectural decision rationale
- Performance and security implementation patterns
- Vue 3 and TypeScript specific gotchas and solutions
