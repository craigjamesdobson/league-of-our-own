## üéØ Current Focus

**Phase 3: TDD Infrastructure & Testing Foundation**

### Objective
- **What**: Establish comprehensive TDD infrastructure for team builder functionality
- **Goal**: Create behavior-driven test foundation for maintainable, reliable code
- **Approach**: Test-first development with focus on business behavior validation

### Implementation Plan
- **Test Infrastructure**: Vitest configuration, test data factories, behavior patterns
- **Priority Areas**: Budget calculations, player selection, form validation, data persistence
- **Next Steps**: Set up test environment and create first behavior tests

## üß™ TDD Implementation Notes

### Session: 2025-01-12 - Foundation Setup

**Objective**: Establish TDD infrastructure for team builder
**Approach**: 
1. Set up Vitest configuration for behavior-driven testing
2. Create test data factories using real project schemas
3. Implement first behavior tests for core business logic
4. Document TDD patterns for future development

**Priority Test Areas**: 
- Budget calculation business logic (team value, remaining budget, over-budget validation)
- Player selection rules (team structure, position requirements)
- Form validation behavior (required fields, business rules)
- Data persistence workflows (team creation, editing, updates)

**TDD Principles Applied**:
- Test behavior through public APIs only
- Use real schemas from project, never redefine
- Focus on business requirements, not implementation
- Write failing tests first, then minimal code to pass

**Progress**: Ready to begin implementation

## üìÅ Files for TDD Implementation

### Primary Focus - TEST SETUP
- **File**: `tests/team-builder/composables/useTeamBuilder.test.ts` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Behavior-driven tests for core business logic
- **Priority**: Budget calculations, player selection validation

### Test Data Factories
- **File**: `tests/team-builder/fixtures/teams.ts` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Factory functions for DraftedTeam test data with sensible defaults
- **File**: `tests/team-builder/fixtures/players.ts` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Factory functions for DraftedTeamPlayer test data

### Configuration
- **File**: `vitest.config.ts` (may need team builder specific config)
- **Purpose**: Test environment setup for team builder functionality
- **Status**: To be reviewed and configured for TDD approach

## üß™ Testing Status & Plans

### Manual Testing Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] New team creation workflow (full end-to-end)
- [x] Existing team editing workflow (form population working)
- [x] Form validation and submission (all error cases)
- [x] Email generation functionality (both user and admin emails)

### TDD Implementation Roadmap
- [x] Set up Vitest configuration for team builder tests ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Configure global Supabase mocking for isolated testing ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create test directory structure and scripts ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Create test data factories using real project schemas
- [ ] Implement behavior tests for budget calculation logic
- [ ] Add tests for player selection and team structure validation
- [ ] Cover form validation business rules
- [ ] Test data persistence workflows (create/edit/update)

### Testing Philosophy Applied
- **Behavior-Driven**: Test through public APIs, treat implementation as black box
- **Business Logic Focus**: 100% coverage of business behavior, not implementation details
- **Real Schemas**: Use actual DraftedTeam, DraftedTeamPlayer types from project
- **TDD First**: Write failing tests before any new production code

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Context

### Current Architecture Status
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ TypeScript fixes complete, zero technical debt
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Composable extraction complete, architecture refactored
- **Phase 2.5**: ‚úÖ Form population bug resolved with reactive key pattern
- **Phase 2.6**: ‚úÖ Final TypeScript/linting issues resolved, manual testing validated
- **Phase 3.1**: ‚úÖ TDD infrastructure established, Vitest configured, ready for behavior testing
- **Known Working**: All critical user workflows, single instance pattern, budget calculations
- **Known Issues**: None - foundation established for TDD implementation

### Key Patterns Successfully Implemented
- **Composable Architecture**: `useTeamBuilder()` in parent, props to children
- **Data Flow**: Parent composable ‚Üí props ‚Üí child components (proven pattern)
- **State Management**: Reactive refs and computed properties with proper reactivity
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper RPC type overrides
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback

### Ready for TDD
- **Testable Business Logic**: All business logic extracted to composable
- **Stable API**: Public interface established and validated
- **Type Foundation**: All types properly defined and aligned
- **Manual Validation**: Core workflows tested and working

## üîó Quick Reference

### Development Commands
```bash
pnpm dev         # Start development server
pnpm lint        # Check for issues

## üí° TDD Session Guidelines

### When Starting TDD Work
1. Update the "Current Focus" section with specific TDD goals
2. Note the test files and business behavior being implemented
3. Record the failing test and expected behavior

### During TDD Implementation
1. Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly
2. Add test implementation notes and patterns discovered
3. Update progress on behavior coverage
4. Note any architecture insights or patterns

### When Finishing TDD Session  
1. Update session status and test coverage achieved
2. Note next behavior to implement
3. Update strategic documents with TDD learnings
4. Document any new patterns or factories created

### TDD Cycle Reminders
- **Red**: Write failing test first (business behavior focus)
- **Green**: Minimal code to make test pass
- **Refactor**: Assess and improve code quality
- **Never**: Write production code without failing test
