## 🧪 TDD Implementation Strategy

### **Testing Philosophy (Established)**
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Verify expected business behavior as black box
- **TDD First**: All production code written in response to failing tests
- **Business Logic Focus**: 100% coverage of business behavior
- **Real Schemas**: Use actual project schemas, never redefine in tests

### **Current Test Infrastructure Status**
✅ **Vitest Configuration**: Working with Happy DOM environment  
✅ **Global Mocking**: Supabase and Nuxt composables mocked  
✅ **Test Structure**: `/tests/team-builder/` directory established  
✅ **Factory Patterns**: Test data factories ready for implementation  

### **Priority Test Coverage Areas**
1. **Budget Calculations** - Team value, remaining budget, over-budget validation
2. **Player Selection** - Team structure validation, position requirements
3. **Form Validation** - Required fields, business rules, error messages
4. **Data Persistence** - Team creation, editing, player updates
