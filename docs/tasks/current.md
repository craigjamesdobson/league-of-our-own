# Current Work - Team Builder

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-12  
**Status**: Phase 1 & 2 Validated Complete - Ready for Phase 3  

## Active Work Streams

### ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Focus: Phase 3 - TDD Implementation**
**Owner**: Lead Developer  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Sprint Goal**: Establish comprehensive test-driven development foundation  

**Objective**: Set up TDD infrastructure and create behavior-driven tests for team builder functionality

**Current Phase**: Phase 3 - User Experience & Testing Enhancements
- Test infrastructure setup
- Test data factories 
- First behavior-driven tests for useTeamBuilder composable
- TDD documentation and patterns

**Status**: Ready to begin - all prerequisites completed

---

## Work Stream Status

### âœ… **Completed & Validated**
- **Phase 1**: All TypeScript errors resolved, reactive data fixed, linting clean
- **Phase 2**: Business logic extracted to `useTeamBuilder` composable, architecture refactored
- **Validation**: Manual testing passed for both create and edit workflows
- **TypeScript Fixes**: RPC type overrides, parameter type corrections, deprecated syntax removal
- **Architecture**: Single instance pattern implemented successfully
- **Code Quality**: All linting issues resolved, type safety restored

### ðŸ”„ **In Progress**
- **Phase 3 Setup**: TDD infrastructure preparation
  - Vitest configuration for team builder
  - Test data factories for DraftedTeamPlayer, DraftedTeam types
  - Behavior-driven test patterns establishment
  - Documentation of TDD approach in CLAUDE.md

### ðŸ“‹ **Queued for Phase 3**
- **Test Implementation**: Core business logic behavior tests
- **Performance**: Optimize selectedPlayerIds computation, virtual scrolling
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Validation**: Real-time validation feedback, enhanced error messages

## TDD Implementation Strategy

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Tests verify expected business behavior treating code as a black box
- **TDD First**: All production code must be written in response to failing tests
- **Business Logic Focus**: 100% coverage of business behavior, not implementation details
- **Real Schemas**: Use actual project schemas in tests, never redefine them

### Priority Test Areas
1. **Budget Calculations**: Team value, remaining budget, over-budget validation
2. **Player Selection**: Team structure validation, position requirements
3. **Form Validation**: Required fields, business rules, error messages
4. **Data Persistence**: Team creation, editing, player updates

### Test Organization Structure
