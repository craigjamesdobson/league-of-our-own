# Current Sprint - Team Builder

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-25  

## 🔄 Active Sprint Tasks

### **Primary Focus: TDD Infrastructure & Testing**
**Sprint Goal**: Establish comprehensive test-driven development foundation for team builder

- **🔄 Chore: TDD infrastructure setup**
  - Vitest configuration optimization
  - Test data factories for core types
  - Global mocking configuration refinement
  - Documentation of TDD patterns

- **📋 Enhancement: First behavior-driven tests**
  - Budget calculation test coverage
  - Player selection validation tests
  - Form validation behavior tests
  - Team submission workflow tests

**Status**: Foundation ready - all prerequisites completed from previous sprints

## 📋 Sprint Backlog (Next Up)

### **Immediate Next Sprint**
- **Enhancement: Performance optimization**
  - Optimize selectedPlayerIds computation
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large player lists

- **Enhancement: Accessibility improvements**
  - Add ARIA labels for screen readers
  - Implement keyboard navigation
  - Improve focus management

- **Enhancement: Advanced form validation**
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Enhanced error messages
  - Progressive validation states

- **Documentation: TDD guide completion**
  - Finalize testing patterns documentation
  - Update CLAUDE.md with established practices

## ✅ **Recently Completed Prerequisites**
- ✅ **Bug: TypeScript errors resolved** - Zero technical debt achieved
- ✅ **Enhancement: Composable architecture** - Business logic extracted
- ✅ **Feature: Security integration** - Cloudflare Turnstile implemented
- ✅ **Bug: Form display issues** - Reactive key pattern applied

## 🧪 TDD Implementation Strategy

### **Testing Philosophy (Established)**
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Verify expected business behavior as black box
- **TDD First**: All production code written in response to failing tests
- **Business Logic Focus**: 100% coverage of business behavior
- **Real Schemas**: Use actual project schemas, never redefine in tests

### **Current Test Infrastructure Status**
✅ **Vitest Configuration**: Working with Happy DOM environment  
✅ **Global Mocking**: Supabase and Nuxt composables mocked  
✅ **Test Structure**: `/tests/team-builder/` directory established  
✅ **Factory Patterns**: Test data factories ready for implementation  

### **Priority Test Coverage Areas**
1. **Budget Calculations** - Team value, remaining budget, over-budget validation
2. **Player Selection** - Team structure validation, position requirements
3. **Form Validation** - Required fields, business rules, error messages
4. **Data Persistence** - Team creation, editing, player updates

## 📊 Sprint Metrics

### **Technical Health (Current)**
- ✅ **TypeScript Errors**: 0 (maintained)
- ✅ **Lint Issues**: 0 (maintained)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Business logic ready for comprehensive testing
- ✅ **Critical User Flows**: All validated and working
- ✅ **Security**: Bot protection active and effective

### **Development Progress Tracking**
