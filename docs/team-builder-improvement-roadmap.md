# Team Builder Improvement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a systematic approach to improving the team builder functionality over 4 phases, prioritizing critical issues first and building towards a more maintainable, testable, and user-friendly system.

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
**Goal:** Resolve type safety issues and fix reactive data problems

### Objectives
- ✅ Eliminate all TypeScript errors
- ✅ Fix reactive data declarations
- ✅ Create shared type definitions
- ✅ Ensure basic functionality works correctly

### Key Deliverables
1. **Type Safety Resolution**
   - Remove all `@ts-ignore` comments
   - Fix `draftedTeamPlayers` typing
   - Resolve null safety issues in computed properties

2. **Reactive Data Fixes**
   - Correct reactive data declarations
   - Ensure proper Vue reactivity system integration
   - Fix UI update issues

3. **Shared Type Definitions**
   - Extract `DraftedTeamPlayer` interface to shared location
   - Create consistent type definitions across components
   - Add proper type exports

### Success Criteria
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in team builder files
- [ ] UI updates correctly when players are selected/deselected
- [ ] Form validation works as expected
- [ ] No runtime type errors

### Estimated Effort
**2-3 days** for a skilled developer

## Phase 2: Code Organization (Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Improve maintainability and separation of concerns

### Objectives
- ✅ Extract business logic from components
- ✅ Add proper error handling
- ✅ Implement loading states
- ✅ Simplify complex functions

### Key Deliverables
1. **Create `useTeamBuilder` Composable**
   - Extract data fetching logic
   - Implement team management operations
   - Add error handling and loading states

2. **Refactor Complex Functions**
   - Break down `setTeamPlayers` into smaller functions
   - Separate concerns (filtering, mapping, validation)
   - Add proper error boundaries

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Implement graceful fallbacks
   - Provide better user feedback

4. **Loading States**
   - Add skeleton loaders
   - Show progress indicators
   - Implement optimistic updates

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Business logic separated from presentation
- [ ] Proper error handling with retry mechanisms
- [ ] Loading states improve user experience
- [ ] Functions are focused and testable

### Estimated Effort
**5-7 days** for a skilled developer

## Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements (Week 4-5)
**Goal:** Improve usability and accessibility

### Objectives
- ✅ Optimize performance for large datasets
- ✅ Add accessibility features
- ✅ Improve form validation
- ✅ Enhanced user feedback

### Key Deliverables
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize `selectedPlayerIds` computation
   - Add virtual scrolling for large player lists
   - Implement efficient filtering algorithms

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility
   - Add focus management

3. **Enhanced Form Validation**
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Better error messages
   - Field-level validation
   - Improved UX patterns

4. **User Feedback Improvements**
   - Better toast messages
   - Progress indicators
   - Success confirmations
   - Help text and guidance

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with large datasets
- [ ] Meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- [ ] Form validation provides clear, actionable feedback
- [ ] Users can complete tasks efficiently

### Estimated Effort
**4-6 days** for a skilled developer

## Phase 4: Architecture & Testing (Week 6-8)
**Goal:** Ensure long-term maintainability and reliability

### Objectives
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Monitoring and analytics

### Key Deliverables
1. **Test Suite Implementation**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for components
   - End-to-end tests for critical paths
   - Test data factories

2. **Configuration System**
   - Extract hard-coded values
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Season management system
   - Feature flags

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Component usage guidelines
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Architecture decision records

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - User behavior analytics
   - Health checks

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for business logic
- [ ] All configuration externalized
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting in place

### Estimated Effort
**8-10 days** for a skilled developer

## Dependencies Between Phases

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
- Type safety must be resolved before refactoring
- Reactive data fixes enable proper composable extraction

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- Composables provide foundation for performance optimizations
- Error handling enables better user feedback

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
- Performance optimizations inform monitoring requirements
- UX improvements guide testing priorities

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration** - Ensure existing user data remains intact
2. **Breaking Changes** - Maintain backward compatibility
3. **Performance Regression** - Monitor performance throughout changes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain comprehensive test suite
- Create rollback plans for each phase
- Monitor key metrics during deployment

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Lead Developer**: Full-time for all phases
- **QA Engineer**: Part-time for phases 3-4
- **UX Designer**: Part-time for phase 3

### Infrastructure
- **Staging Environment**: For testing changes
- **Monitoring Tools**: For performance tracking
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated testing and deployment

## Success Metrics
